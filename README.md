# JavaScript-React-Practices

## This repository contains my mini-projects/components in JavaScript and ReactJS that I've built while learning frontend development and APIs. Replace 'X' with the folder name to view the live demo. If there is a space in the folder name, replace it with '%20'. For example, 'Colour%20Changer'â€”add this replacing 'X' to view the live demo (only works if the project is in Vanilla JS).

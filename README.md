# JavaScript-React-Practices

## This repository contains my mini-projects/components in JavaScript and ReactJS that I've built while learning frontend development and APIs. Replace 'X' with the folder name to view the live demo. If there is a space in the folder name, replace it with '%20'. For example, 'Colour%20Changer'â€”add this replacing 'X' to view the live demo (only works if the project is in Vanilla JS).

Replace the 'X' in the link following the instructions mentioned above (works only for projects in Vanilla JS).
